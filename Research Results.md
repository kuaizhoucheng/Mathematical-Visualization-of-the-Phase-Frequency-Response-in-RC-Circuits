Reflecting on an initial conceptual confusion regarding RC circuits, I posited that capacitor impedance was the primary factor causing phase deviation. Consequently, I reasoned that under low-frequency current input, a large angular frequency (ω) would yield minimal impedance, thereby resulting in a very small phase difference angle (φ). <br>
My error stemmed from conflating several key concepts. Firstly, it is essential to clarify the precise influence of impedance. Computational simulations demonstrate that impedance magnitude, irrespective of its value, consistently establishes a fixed 90° phase difference between the voltage across the capacitor and the current through it. The actual effect of impedance is to introduce a phase lag between the input voltage and the input current, though this lag is inherently less than the capacitor's 90°.<br>
The operational principle of the low-pass filter circuit is as follows:<br>
1. The phase difference between capacitor voltage and capacitor current remains constant at 90°.<br>
2. The phase difference between resistor voltage and resistor current remains constant at 0°.<br>
3. As the angular frequency (ω) increases, the capacitor's impedance decreases.<br>
4. This reduction in impedance progressively diminishes the phase difference between the input voltage and input current.<br>
5. Consequently, the phase difference between the input voltage and the output voltage (capacitor voltage) increases.<br>
6. As ω approaches infinity, the capacitor's impedance tends towards zero. Under this condition:<br>
   6.1 The input voltage phase aligns almost precisely with the input current phase.<br>
   6.2 The capacitor voltage phase maintains its 90° difference relative to the current phase.<br>
7. Therefore, the phase angle φ asymptotically approaches 90°.<br>

This investigation underscores the necessity of subjecting subjective intuition to meticulous scrutiny, as conceptual confusion can readily arise during reasoning. The outcome, however, is constructive: achieving a clear understanding of the underlying principles. It is hoped this clarification proves beneficial to others.<br>
