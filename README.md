# Mathematical-Visualization-of-the-Phase-Frequency-Response-in-RC-Circuits
This code visualizes why the capacitor voltage's phase lead over input grows with frequency in RC circuits. While impedance causes the shift, complex functions make mathematical visualization challenging. Manim is used to illustrate this relationship mathematically.
